 Steps to get started with the App.

1. Browse using root.html - This is the landing page for the shopping cart.

2. Use Edit button on the Shopping Bag page to open a modal-overlay where size, quantity and color can be
   changed and the same will be reflected on the main page once the user clicks edit of the modal-overlay.

3. The Total and Discount get automatically rendered in the shopping page at the bottom based on number of
   items

4.User can remove item using the remove button and the total and discount will be automatically updated on
   the page.

5. As the user moves on smaller screens, the help section disappers and the table is shown properly aligned
   as per the screen size.Similarly, modal overlay resizes itself for devices lesser than width 1000px.

 Warnings or Errors :

 1. You might encounter CORS error in chrome browser, to overcome it just use Ctrl+Shift+R - hard reload and the issue will go away.
